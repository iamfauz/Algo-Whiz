- Speed controls to visualize algorithms in real-time.
- Comprehensive learning material which includes pseudocode, runtime cheat sheets to enhance understanding of algorithms. (COMING SOON)
- Docker ready (COMING SOON)

## Architecture
The architecture used in the MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture. The state management solution used to employ MVVM in flutter is the Provider + ChangeNotifier patttern. https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple
